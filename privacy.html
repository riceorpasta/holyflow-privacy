    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h2>
    <p>The information we collect depends on the services and functionality you request. You may decline to submit personal information; however, that may limit our ability to provide certain services or functionality.</p>

    <h3>Personal information you provide to us.</h3>
    <p>You need to create an account to use most features of the HolyFlow app, typically via third-party authentication services like Facebook or Google. When you register using these services, we receive Personal Identifiers such as your name and email address as provided by that service according to your permissions. We use this information to create and associate you with your specific HolyFlow Member account.</p>
    <p>Beyond initial registration, you have choices about what additional information you might provide (e.g., through feedback forms, support requests, or optional profile fields if available). We collect personal data from you when you provide, post, or upload it to HolyFlow. You do not have to provide additional information; however, if you do not, it may limit our ability to personalize HolyFlow and your ability to use certain features.</p>

    <h3>Your User Contributions (if applicable).</h3>
    <p>If HolyFlow allows users to create, publish, distribute, or display content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared devotionals, comments - collectively, “User Contributions”), we process this information to facilitate your ability to create, use, store, and distribute the User Contribution as you choose. We associate your User Contributions with your account. Please be mindful if you share User Contributions publicly or with others; we cannot control the actions of others with whom you share.</p>

    <h3>Communications from you to us.</h3>
    <p>We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages from us, including when you submit personal information or requests by emailing <strong>skyrevealed@gmail.com</strong> or through other support channels. We retain and use those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve HolyFlow.</p>

    <h2>Automatic Data Collection Technologies</h2>
    <p>By using HolyFlow, you agree to the use of technologies like Software Development Kits (SDKs) and similar tools for analytics and essential app functionality.</p>

    <h3>Analytics and Similar Technologies.</h3>
    <p>We use analytics tools (potentially including SDKs from providers like Google Firebase Analytics) to recognize you and/or your device(s) across uses of HolyFlow. These help provide the best user experience, allow us to recognize you, maintain preferences, keep your account secure, and generally improve functionality. They help ensure Member information is used with the correct account.</p>
    <p>We collect details of your use of HolyFlow (including traffic data, approximate IP location data, logs, device type, operating system, the functionality requested, and timing of requests) and the resources you access, use, and create. We use this information to provide a tailored experience and communicate effectively. The information helps determine aggregate usage, track usage, analyze data, and improve functionality. We may combine this information for a better experience and service quality.</p>
    <p>We do NOT use these technologies to facilitate interest-based ads for third-party goods or services within HolyFlow.</p>

    <h3>Attribution providers (if applicable).</h3>
    <p>If we advertise HolyFlow on third-party sites (e.g., Facebook, Google), we may use SDKs to attribute an app download to a specific advertisement. We do not sell your personal information, nor allow our SDK providers to sell it or use it to solicit third-party goods/services. We may provide aggregate, de-identified information about ad performance.</p>

    <h3>Device ID, IP address and network access.</h3>
    <p>When you use HolyFlow, we receive data from your devices and networks, including device identifiers and IP address. We may process IP addresses with public location data related to your ISP/carrier to determine approximate geographic region for aggregate, de-identified usage analysis (e.g., understanding usage by country). We may also check network status (WiFi vs. cellular) to optimize content delivery (e.g., loading higher resolution images on WiFi). This network status information is not stored or shared long-term.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use data collected about you, provided by you, and inferences we make as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, support, and personalize HolyFlow and its functionality.</li>
        <li>To create, maintain, customize, and secure your HolyFlow account.</li>
        <li>To process your requests and respond to inquiries.</li>
        <li>To provide information on HolyFlow updates or related services.</li>
        <li>To maintain the safety, security, and integrity of HolyFlow and its infrastructure.</li>
        <li>For development, internal analysis, and improving the app.</li>
        <li>To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.</li>
        <li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights under this Policy and our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
        <li>As described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.</li>
        <li>For any other purpose with your consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Membership.</h3>
    <p>We use your Personal Identifiers (name, email from auth provider) to create, maintain, authorize, and authenticate your access to your account. We store this and usage information (including User Contributions, if any) as long as you are a Member.</p>

    <h3>Connecting with Others (if applicable).</h3>
    <p>If HolyFlow allows communication or connection with other users, it is your choice whether to connect and share information or User Contributions.</p>

    <h3>Features related to your location (if applicable).</h3>
    <p>If HolyFlow offers location-based features and you choose to share your precise location, we use it solely to provide those features, personalize your experience, and for internal analysis. We assume consent until you revoke permission via device settings. Choosing not to share location may limit or disable these specific features but won't affect non-location features.</p>

    <h3>HolyFlow Content and Usage.</h3>
    <p>We collect how you use HolyFlow and its content (e.g., devotionals accessed, features used). We process this to allow you to access content across sessions. If you create User Contributions (notes, highlights), we store them with your account. It's your choice whether to create or access content. We may use usage information and inferences to recommend other HolyFlow content or features.</p>

    <h3>Communications from us to you.</h3>
    <p>We may communicate via push notification, email, or in-app messages regarding your account, app updates, or features. You can typically manage push notification settings in your device or app settings. Emails will generally include an unsubscribe link (except for essential service/security messages).</p>

    <h3>Analytics and performance.</h3>
    <p>We internally analyze available personal data, usage patterns, and inferences to provide/update HolyFlow, communicate, and for internal analytics (e.g., observing trends related to content). We may work with trusted third parties (like analytics providers) for this research under privacy controls. We may disclose aggregate, de-identified usage statistics that do not identify individuals.</p>

    <h2>Sensitive Data</h2>
    <p>Using HolyFlow indicates an interest in its religious content, but we don't assume specific beliefs or require you to state them. Some features might implicitly involve processing data related to religious/philosophical beliefs (e.g., tracking devotional progress). We will obtain explicit consent where required before processing such data for specific features. If you include sensitive information in User Contributions (e.g., notes), we assume your consent to process it solely to provide that functionality. We will not sell your sensitive personal information. We may share it only with essential service providers bound by confidentiality who enable app features. You can withdraw consent by ceasing use of relevant features or contacting us, though this may limit functionality.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third-party advertisers or ad networks for their advertising purposes.</p>

    <h3>Disclosure on your behalf.</h3>
    <p>We may disclose personal information to fulfill our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>, accomplish the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose you request, or with your consent.</p>

    <h3>Disclosure by you.</h3>
    <p>If you share information through HolyFlow (e.g., via future sharing features), it's viewable by you and those you share it with. Linking your account to third-party services means they access shared data per their policies.</p>

    <h3>Internal disclosure.</h3>
    <p>We process personal data internally within Style Accelerator and potentially among affiliates (if any) to provide and improve services.</p>

    <h3>Service providers.</h3>
    <p>We disclose personal information to contractors, service providers (e.g., cloud hosting like Google Cloud/Firebase, analytics providers, customer support tools), and other third parties essential to support HolyFlow and our operations. They access your information only as reasonably necessary to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</p>

    <h3>HolyFlow content providers (if applicable).</h3>
    <p>If we license content from third parties, we generally do not share your personal information with them. We may provide aggregate, de-identified analytics about content usage (e.g., usage by country).</p>

    <h3>Legal process.</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief it's necessary to investigate/prevent illegal activities, enforce agreements, investigate claims, protect security/integrity, or protect rights and safety. We attempt to notify users of legal demands unless prohibited or in emergencies. We reserve the right to confidentially disclose personal information in connection with a potential or actual merger or acquisition.</p>

    <h2>Deleting, Accessing, and Correcting Your Information</h2>
    <h3>How to make your requests.</h3>
    <p>For personal data we have about you, subject to applicable law (e.g., Swiss FADP, GDPR), you may request:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Ask us to erase some or all of your personal data. This may limit app functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction/Modification:</strong> Edit data through your account (if applicable) or ask us to change/update inaccurate data.</li>
        <li><strong>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data:</strong> Ask us to stop using some or all data or limit its use.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data (Portability):</strong> Ask for a copy of your personal data in a machine-readable format where required by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make a request, please email <strong>skyrevealed@gmail.com</strong> or mail us at Style Accelerator Sarl, LLC, Chemin des Ravines 7, 2034 Peseux, Switzerland. Include your name, email address associated with the account, and the specific request. We may need additional information to verify your identity. We may decline requests if we cannot verify identity, if it jeopardizes others' privacy, violates law, or for similar legitimate reasons. We will not discriminate for exercising your rights. We generally do not charge unless requests are excessive, repetitive, or unfounded.</p>

    <h3>Deleting your account.</h3>
    <p>You can typically delete your HolyFlow account via the app settings (if available) or by contacting us. Deleting your account removes associated personal data and User Contributions from our active systems. We may retain data if legally required, for security, fraud prevention, or to enforce rights. De-identified, aggregated data may be retained. Deletion usually occurs within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 14-30 days), though backups or cached data may take longer to cycle out. Information you shared with others may remain visible elsewhere.</p>

    <h2>Security and Protection</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security safeguards (like encryption during transmission and at rest) designed to protect your data. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we monitor for vulnerabilities, we cannot guarantee absolute security against unauthorized intrusion or breach.</p>

    <h2>Children Under the Age of 16</h2>
    <p>HolyFlow is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we might have collected information from your child under 16, please contact us immediately at <strong>skyrevealed@gmail.com</strong> so we can delete it. Parents/guardians are responsible for supervising any use of the app by minors.</p>

    <h2>Processing of Data (Lawful Bases)</h2>
    <p>We only collect and process personal data where we have lawful bases under applicable law (e.g., Swiss FADP, GDPR). These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where you have given clear consent (e.g., for optional features, sensitive data processing).</li>
        <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (i.e., providing the HolyFlow service as described in the <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Where processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party, provided these interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms. Examples include providing/improving the service, security, understanding usage patterns, communicating with you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw it. Where we rely on legitimate interests, you may have the right to object. Contact us if you have questions about lawful bases.</p>
    <p>We generally retain personal data associated with your account until the account is deleted, unless a different retention period is necessary for specific data or required by law.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Information Collection</h2>
    <p>HolyFlow may contain links to or integrate with third-party websites, services, or apps (e.g., Facebook/Google login). Review their privacy policies as we are not responsible for their practices. Linking your HolyFlow account with third-party services may share data between them according to your permissions.</p>

    <h2>Users from Outside Switzerland</h2>
    <p>HolyFlow is operated from Switzerland. Your use of HolyFlow and this Policy are governed by Swiss law. If using HolyFlow from outside Switzerland, be aware your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in Switzerland and potentially other countries where our service providers operate (e.g., USA for cloud hosting). Data protection laws may differ from your country. By using HolyFlow, you consent to this transfer and processing as described in this Policy.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy periodically to reflect changes in practices or legal requirements. As we improve HolyFlow, we might collect new data or use it differently. Material changes will be notified via the app or by updating the "Last Modified" date. Please review this Policy periodically. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
