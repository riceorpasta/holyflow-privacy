    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="last-modified">Last Modified on May 1, 2025</p>

    <p>As noted in the policy below, the English language version of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use will govern your relationship with HolyFlow. While the English version will govern, you can also use an automatic translation tool like Google Translate to view the documents in your language. Any further translation revisions will be posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of these Terms</h2>
    <p>By using HolyFlow sites, services, and mobile applications (together, “HolyFlow”), whether as a guest or a registered user, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use HolyFlow, as well as the HolyFlow <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms or the HolyFlow Privacy Policy you must not access or use HolyFlow.</p>

    <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>HolyFlow is offered by Style Accelerator Sarl, LLC (“Style Accelerator”, “we” or “us”). We may revise and update these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. Any changes are effective when we post them. Your continued use of HolyFlow following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>
    <p>Where HolyFlow has provided you with a translation other than the English language version of the Terms of Use, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language version of the Terms of Use will govern your relationship with HolyFlow. If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms of Use says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.</p>

    <p>While we hope to always offer HolyFlow and all of its features, we reserve the right to change or cease offering HolyFlow or any part, portion, or functionality of HolyFlow without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of HolyFlow is unavailable at any time.</p>

    <h2>Account Security</h2>
    <p>HolyFlow allows users to create an account, often requiring authentication through third-party services (like Facebook or Google) or providing certain information to Style Accelerator. If you choose or are provided with a user name, password, access token, or similar information as part of our security procedures, you agree to treat such information as confidential, and agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your account or any other breach of security.

    <p>You agree that we have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>take any action with respect to any user, account, or User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe there to be a violation of these Terms, infringement of third party rights, a threat to the personal safety of others, or a threat, liability, or harm to the goodwill associated with HolyFlow or Style Accelerator;</li>
        <li>take appropriate action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement and disclosure of your information, for any illegal or unauthorized use of HolyFlow; and/or</li>
